GAMEPLAY:
My game is an escape-the-room game, where the player interacts with objects using preset commands.
The player starts facing the front wall, which has a door on it. They can turn to face different walls, where they will see a description.
Each description will basically list the different objects that the player can see from their perspective. Any key words will be in all caps.
Those key words can be used with commands in order to escape. The key is a gem, which is split into 8 pieces, hidden throughout the room.
The gem is used to open the door.


STORY:
The player appears in a mysterious room, which, according to the narrator, has been sealed away from the rest of the world by a curse.
The curse was put on to prevent the secret of immortality from getting out to the rest of the world. In the room, there are 8 red gem shards,
which the player needs to collect to create the key that will unlock the door.


SOURCES:
https://stackoverflow.com/ - This was the source I used anytime I had issues or questions.
The "Questions" page/forum with old questions helped me solve a lot of problems in my code.

I also used the old slides from during the school year, but the primary source I used throughout this project is the one above.

This is a link to an overhead view of the room. It shows all four walls together, with most of the objects laid out.
It is a remake of something I drew for planning/brainstorming before actually coding the game.

This is a picture of another reference I drew to help myself see the room and describe it better, wall by wall.
It also shows location and ideas for actual escape aspects, including locks, keys, and other ways to get objects.
This is from the brainstorming stage, so it is slightly different from the final game layout.
