GAMEPLAY:
My game is an escape-the-room game, where the player interacts with objects using preset commands.
The player starts facing the front wall, which has a door on it. They can turn to face different walls, where they will see a description.
Each description will basically list the different objects that the player can see from their perspective. Any key words will be in all caps.
Those key words can be used with commands in order to escape. The key is a gem, which is split into 8 pieces, hidden throughout the room.
The gem is used to open the door.

STORY:
The player appears in a mysterious room, which, according to the narrator, has been sealed away from the rest of the world by a curse.
The curse was put on to prevent the secret of immortality from getting out to the rest of the world. The gem is a magic gem.
It's the anchor for the curse, but somehow, the curse went wrong and the gem broke into 8 pieces, spreading across the room.
One piece somehow made it back to the regular universe and into the possession of the player, which is the reason s/he made it into the room,
despite the curse.
